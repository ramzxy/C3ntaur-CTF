| `UnlockCondition` | Challenge unlock requirements |

| `Submission` | Challenge submission tracking and validation |
| `Announcement` | Platform-wide announcements |
| `ActivityLog` | Team activity tracking |
| `GameConfig` | CTF game timing and state configuration |
| `ChallengeFile` | Challenge attachment management |
| `Hint` | Challenge hints with point costs |
| `TeamHint` | Tracks which teams have purchased hints |
| `SiteConfig` | Platform configuration settings |
